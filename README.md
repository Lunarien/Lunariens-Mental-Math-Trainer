## In the program
When you start the program, you will be met with a menu screen with several action options. You can currently do the following:
* Train with a never-ending problem set
* View a statistic file (as a graph) from the *stats* folder by selecting it from a list
* View a statistic file (as a graph) from the *stats* folder by typing out the digit code of the problem stats saved in the file. Note that the name of the file corresponds to the problem statistics saved in it
* Exit LMMT

When training in speech mode, you can press enter without having any text typed out to repeat the problem, in case you misheard or forgot it.





# Capabilities
* Text to speech capabilities (!!)
* Timing
* Statistics
* Graphing statistics

# Plans
* Custom averages (like average of 10 problems, of 5, and arithmetic means)
* bursts of problems (e. g. 10 problems at a time)
* using multiple problem types in one training session
* Bigger number capabilities
* Bug fixes

# Limitations
* The program currently only accepts single numbers for X, Y and Z in the digit code.
* When entering a wrong answer, you don't get to try again. I might try to implement trying again sometime.
