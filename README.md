# Lunariens-Mental-Math-Trainer
I started developing this program in order to practice my mental math skills, and I wanted to share it to the public so that anyone could do the same.

I am looking to make this program as customizable as possible to fullfill any needs.
# Usage

<details>

<summary>Prerequisites for using the program</summary>

## Prerequisites

3. Find the section "Manage voices", and click "Add voices".

## In the program
When you start the program, you will be met with a menu screen with several action options. You can currently do the following:
* Train with a custom problem set
* View a statistic file (as a graph) from the *stats* folder by selecting it from a list
* View a statistic file (as a graph) from the *stats* folder by typing out the digit code of the problem stats saved in the file. Note that the name of the file corresponds to the problem statistics saved in it.
* View a statistic file (through a console menu) from the *stats* folder by selecting it from a list
* View a statistic file (through a console menu) from the *stats* folder by typing out the digit code of the problem stats saved in the file.
* Exit LMMT

When training in speech mode, you can press enter without having any text typed out to repeat the problem, in case you misheard or forgot it.





# Capabilities
* Text to speech capabilities (uncommon amongst other trainers)
* No silence at the end of the text-to-speech audio, making solve times much closer to correct. (unique to LMMT)
* Timing
* Bursts of problems (e. g. 10 problems at a time)
* Using multiple problem types in one training session
* Statistics
* Graphing statistics
* Precise operand definitions (not by number of digits, but by a number range)
* Practically unlimited number capabilities (up to around 10 thousand-digit numbers)

# Planned features
* (Custom) averages (like average of 10 problems, of 5, and arithmetic means)
* Chain calculation mode (LMMT outputs a problem consisting of several (3+) numbers. User types the result of this longer problem.)
* A settings menu
* Cross-platform compatibility
* Bug fixes

# Limitations
* When entering a wrong answer, you don't get to try again. I might try to implement trying again sometime.
